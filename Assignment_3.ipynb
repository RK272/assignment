    "Functions are advantageous in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions allow you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each function can perform a specific task,\n",
    "          making your code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Once a function is defined, it can be reused throughout your program or in different programs without rewriting the same code.\n",
    "          This reduces redundancy and saves time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Functions help organize code logically, making it easier for others (or yourself at a later time) to read and understand the program.\n",
    "             Each function's name can describe its purpose, providing context for its actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: Isolating code into functions makes it easier to test and debug individual components of your program. If there's an issue, you can test \n",
    "          and fix a specific function without affecting the rest of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability: Functions make it simpler to update or modify code. Changes in functionality can often be made within a specific function without\n",
    "              impacting other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away complex implementation details. Users of the function only need to understand the input and output\n",
    "            , not the internal workings, which simplifies the overall usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: As programs grow larger, functions help manage complexity by structuring code into smaller, discrete units. \n",
    "            This modular approach is essential for scaling up applications."
