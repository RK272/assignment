    "Definition and Scope: Class variables are defined within the class construction but outside any instance methods.\n",
    "They are shared across all instances of the class, meaning that all instances will have the same value for a class variable unless it is modified.\n",
    "Lifetime: Class variables exist as long as the class is in scope.\n",

    "Instance Variables\n",
    "Instance variables are attributes that are specific to each instance of a class. They are defined within instance methods, typically \n",
    "within the __init__ method.\n",
    "Scope: The scope of instance variables is the individual instance of the class. Each instance has its own copy of the instance variables.\n",
    "Usage: Instance variables are used for attributes that can vary between different instances, such as unique properties of an object.\n",
