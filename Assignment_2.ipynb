    "break Statement:\n",
    "Purpose: The break statement is used to exit the current loop prematurely, regardless of whether the loop condition is still true.\n",
    "Effect: When break is encountered, the loop immediately terminates, and control passes to the statement immediately following the loop.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",

    "Output: 0, 1, 2\n",
    "Here, the loop terminates when i equals 3, so 3 is not printed, and the loop stops early.\n",
    "continue Statement:\n",
    "Purpose: The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.\n",
    "Effect: When continue is encountered, the current iteration's remaining code is skipped, and the loop continues with the next iteration.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 2:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "Output: 0, 1, 3, 4\n",
    "Here, when i equals 2, the continue statement is executed, so 2 is not printed, and the loop moves to the next iteration.\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "Functionality: break terminates the entire loop early when a certain condition is met, while continue skips the current iteration and\n",
    "    moves to the next one.\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "break: Used when you want to exit a loop completely based on a condition, regardless of how many iterations remain.\n",
